# Events

Canvas panel exposes the following events:

### ready

This is called when the web component is ready and the APIs are available. This
does not happen when the content is loaded, you will need to use other events or
load the content before.

### world-ready

This is called when image content is loaded into the Atlas Viewer. It will not
fire until the zoom level (scale) has been calculated.

### media

This is fired when a Video or Audio canvas is loaded into the viewer. This is
not currently a strategy supported by Canvas panel.

### choice

This is fired when a choice is available or the state of a choice changes.

### canvas-change

This is fired only in `<canvas-panel />` when a canvas is changed.

### sequence-change

This is fired only in `<sequence-panel />` when a sequence is changed (one or
more canvases displayed).

### sequence

This is fired when a sequence has been loaded and is available - or subsequently
changes, if a range is selected for example.

### zoom-to

This is fired when the users zoom changes - either from calling a zoom method or
scroll-zooming. This is not called when the user calls the `goHome()` method or
when a transition is manually created.

### go-home

This is fired when a user calls the `goHome()` method or uses the keyboard
shortcut.
